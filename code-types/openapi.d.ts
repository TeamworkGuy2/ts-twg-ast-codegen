     *      For example, in /items/{itemId}, the path parameter is itemId.
     *   2. Query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in /items?id=###, the query parameter is id.
     *   3. Header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request.
     *   4. Body - The payload that's appended to the HTTP request. Since there can only be one payload, there can only be one body parameter. The name of the body parameter has no effect on the
     *      parameter itself and is used for documentation purposes only. Since Form parameters are also in the payload, body and form parameters cannot exist together for the same operation.

     *      (in Swagger's definition, the consumes property of an operation). This is the only parameter type that can be used to send files, thus supporting the file type.
     *      Since form parameters are sent in the payload, they cannot be declared together with a body parameter for the same operation. Form parameters have a different format based on the
     *      content-type used (for further details, consult http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4):
     *     - application/x-www-form-urlencoded - Similar to the format of Query parameters but as a payload. For example, foo=1&bar=swagger - both foo and bar are form parameters. This is normally used for simple parameters that are being transferred.
     *     - multipart/form-data - each parameter takes a section in the payload with an internal header. For example, for the header Content-Disposition: form-data; name="submit-name" the name of the parameter is submit-name. This type of form parameters is more commonly used for file transfers
