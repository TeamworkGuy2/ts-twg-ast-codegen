TypeScript TWG AST Code Generator
==============

Dependencies:
- none

TypeScript type transformers and code generator tools for type safe transformation of data structures to code.
This library is designed to integrate with TWG ASTs generated by [jparse-code](https://github.com/TeamworkGuy2/JParseCode).
See the `test/` directory for example usage of the functions in this project.


## API Overview
This library is designed to integrate with TWG ASTs generated by [jparse-code](https://github.com/TeamworkGuy2/JParseCode).
The base CodeAst interfaces found in [code-types/ast-types.d.ts] match the JSON output from `jparse-code`.

You can load data types/models manually via the `TypeTemplate` interface in [code-types/model-types.d.ts](code-types/model-types.d.ts) and use `code-types/TypeConverter` which has methods like `parseTypeTemplate()` and `TypeScript.parseAndConvertTypeTemplate()` to convert the `TypeTemplate` to a `CodeAst.Type`.

Or load JSON output directly from `jparse-code` and cast it to one of the `CodeAst.*` types.

Once you have CodeAst data, you can manipulate it with the help of classes like [code-types/ExtractAst.ts](code-types/ExtractAst.ts) or [code-types/TypeConverter.ts](code-types/TypeConverter.ts).

Finally, output the data back to JSON with `JSON.stringify()` (since the CodeAst interfaces are designed for JSON parsing/stringifying) or transform the data types/models to source code strings using the classes found in `generators/`.
